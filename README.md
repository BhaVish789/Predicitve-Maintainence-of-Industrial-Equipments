# Predicitve-Maintainence-of-Industrial-Equipments
ABSTRACT-
Modern manufacturing processes face huge downtime caused due to mechanical failures in 
Industrial Machines. Conventionally preventive maintenance is being used by various 
companies to manage and handle these failures. Preventive maintenance is the process of 
checking, testing, and analyzing the equipment at regular intervals to determine its proper 
functioning. These frequent checking processes require huge costs leading to greater 
investment in maintenance. Whereas predictive maintenance is the concept through which 
an equipmentâ€™s shutdown period can be determined through its behavior. This approach 
decreases the number of frequent checking to maintain machines. The research paper has 
been proposed with an aim to build a system that can reduce the downtime cost in the 
manufacturing processes in the industries with the use of predictive maintenance. The 
predictive maintenance will be condition-based depending on various factors such as 
volume flow, temperatures, vibrations, and other such factors in the hydraulic system. The 
rotatotory system will be continuously analyzed using an MTN2285/2P sensor and the data 
will be processed by the algorithms. Through the machine learning algorithms, we will 
determine the working and condition of certain mechanical parts. During the research, we 
have determined the changes in data patterns according to the changes in working of the 
gearbox system. Thus, the research paper concludes that building a condition based health 
monitoring system for Industrial Machines can help plan downtimes in advance and hence 
reduce maintenance costs.
